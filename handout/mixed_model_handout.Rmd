### Overview: Statistical Models in R

1. Identify probability distribution of data (more correct: of conditional distribution of the response)
2. Make sure variables are of correct type via `str()`
3. Set appropriate contrasts (orthogonal contrasts if model includes interaction): `afex::set_sum_contrasts()`
4. Describe statistical model using `formula`
4. Fit model: pass `formula` and `data.frame` to corresponding modeling function (e.g., `lm()`, `glm()`)
4. Check model fit (e.g., inspect residuals)
5. Test terms (i.e., main effects and interactions): Pass fitted model to `car::Anova()`
7. Follow-up tests: 
    - Estimated marginal means: Pass fitted model to `lsmeans::lsmeans()`/`emmeans::emmeans()`
    - Specify specific contrasts on estimated marginal means (e.g., `contrast()`, `pairs()`)
   
- `afex` combines fitting (5.) and testing (7.):
    - ANOVAs: `afex::aov_car()`, `afex::aov_ez()`, or `afex::aov_4()`
    - (Generalized) linear mixed-effects models: `afex::mixed()`


### `R` Formula Interface for Statistical Models: `~`

- `R` `formula` interface allows symbolic specification of statistical models, e.g. linear models:  
  `lm(y ~ x, data)`
- Dependent variable(s) left of `~` (can be multivariate or missing), independent variables right of `~`:

| Formula | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Interpretation  |
| ------------------------|---|----------------------------------|
| `~ x` or `~1+x`         || Intercept and main effect of `x` | 
| ` ~ x-1` or `~0 + x`    || Only main effect of `x` and no intercept (questionable) |
| `~ x+y`                 || Main effects of `x` and `y`|
| `~ x:y`                 || Interaction between `x` and `y` (and no main effect) |
| `~ x*y` or `~ x+y+x:y`  || Main effects and interaction between `x` and `y` |


- **Formulas behave differently for coninuous and categorical covariates!!**
    + Always use `str(data)` before fitting: `int` & `num` is continuous, `Factor` or `character` is categorical.
    + Categorical/nominal variables have to be `factor`s. Create via `factor()`.
  
- Categorical variables are transformed into numerical variables using contrast functions (via `model.matrix()`; see Cohen et al., 2002)
    + **If models include interactions, orthogonal contrasts (e.g., `contr.sum`) in which the intercept corresponds to the (unweighted) grand mean should be used**: `afex::set_sum_contrasts()`
    + Dummy/treatment contrasts (`R` default) lead to simple effects for lower order effects.
    + For linear models: Coding only affects interpretation of parameters/tests not overall model fit.

- For models with only numerical covariates, suppressing intercept works as expected.
- For models with categorical covariates, suppressing intercept or other lower-order effects often leads to very surprising results (and should generally be avoided).

### Tests of Model Terms/Effects with `car::Anova()`
- `car::Anova(model, type = 3)` general solution for testing effects.
- Type II and III tests equivalent for balanced designs (i.e., equal group sizes) and highest-order effect.
- Type III tests require orthogonal contrasts (e.g.,`contr.sum`); recommended:
    + For experimental designs in which imbalance is completely random and not structural,
    + Complete cross-over interactions (i.e., main effects in presence of interaction) possible.
- Type II are more appropriate if imbalance is structural (i.e., observational data; maybe here).

### Follow-up Tests with `emmeans` (Formerly `lsmeans`)
- `emmeans(model, ~factor)`  produces estimates marginal means (or least-square means for linear regression) for model terms (e.g., `emmeans(m6, ~education*gender)`).
- Additional functions allow specifying contrasts/follow-up tests on the means, e.g.:
    + `pairs()` tests all pairwise comparisons among means.
    + `contrast()` allows to define arbitrary contrasts on marginal means.
    + For more examples see vignettes: https://cran.r-project.org/package=emmeans 

### ANOVAs with afex

- `afex` ANOVA functions require column with participant ID:
    + `afex::aov_car()` allows specification of ANOVA using `aov`-like formula. Specification of participant id in `Error()` term. For example:  
    `aov_car(dv ~ between_factor + Error(id/within_factor), data)`
    + `afex::aov_4()` allows specification of ANOVA using `lme4`-like formula. Specification of participant id in random term. For example:  
    `aov_4(dv ~ between_factor + (within_factor|id), data)`
    + `afex::aov_ez()` allows specification of ANOVA using characters. For example:  
    `aov_ez("id", "dv", data, between = "between_factor", within = "within_factor")`

### Repeated-Measures, IID Assumption, & Pooling

- Ordinary linear regression, between-subjects ANOVA, and basically all standard statistical models share one assumption: Data points are *independent and identically distributed* (*iid*).
    + Independence assumption refers to residuals: After taking structure of model (i.e., parameters) into account, probability of a data point having a specific value is independent of all other data points.
    + Identical distribution: All observations sampled from same distribution.
- For repeated-measures independence assumption often violated, which can have dramatic consequences on significance tests from model (e.g., increased or decreased Type I errors).
- Three ways to deal with repeated-measures:
    1. *Complete pooling*: Ignore dependency in data (often not appropriate, results likely biased)
    2. *No pooling*: Separate data based on factor producing dependency and calculate separate statistical model for each subset (decreases precision of parameter estimates, combining results can be non-trivial)
    3. *Partial pooling*: Analyse data jointly while taking dependency into account (gold standard, e.g., mixed models)
    
### Mixed Models

- Mixed models extend regular regression models via *random-effects parameters* that account for dependencies among related data points.
- __Fixed Effects__
    - Overall  or *population-level average* effect of specific model term (i.e., main effect, interaction, parameter) on dependent variable
    - Independent of stochastic variability controlled for by random effects
    - Hypothesis tests on fixed effect interpreted as hypothesis tests for terms in standard ANOVA or regression model
    - Possible to test specific hypotheses among factor levels (e.g., planned contrasts)
    - *Fixed-effects parameters*: Overall effect of specific model term on dependent variable
- __Random Effects__
    - *Random-effects grouping factors*: Categorical variables that capture random or stochastic variability (e.g., participants, items, groups, or other hierarchical-structures).
    - In experimental settings, random-effects grouping factors often part of design one wants to generalize over.
    - Random-effects factor out idiosyncrasies of sample, thereby providing a more general estimate of the fixed effects of interest.
    - *Random-effects parameters*: 
        + Provide each level of random-effects grouping factor with idiosyncratic parameter set.
        + zero-centered offsets/displacements for each level of random-effects grouping factor
        + added to specific fixed-effects parameter
        + assumed to follow normal distribution which provides _hierarchical shrinkage_, thereby avoids over-fitting
        + should be added to each parameter that varies within the levels of a random-effects grouping factor (i.e., factor is *crossed* with random-effects grouping factor)


### Random-Effects Parameters in `lme4`/`afex`

| Formula | Interpretation  |
| ------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `(1|s)`         | random intercepts for `s` (i.e., by-`s` random intercepts) | 
| `(1|s) + (1|i)`   |  by-`s` and by-`i` (i.e., crossed) random intercepts |
| `(a|s)` or `(1+a|s)`               | by-`s` random intercepts and by-`s` random slopes for `a` plus their correlation|
| `(a*b|s)`                 | by-`s` random intercepts and by-`s` random slopes for `a`, `b`, and the `a:b` interaction plus correlations among the by-`s` random effects parameters |
| `(0+a|s)`  | by-`s` random slopes for `a` and no random intercept |
| `(a||s)` | by-`s` random intercepts and by-`s` random slopes for `a`, but no correlation (expands to: `(0+a|s) + (1|s)`) |
\emph{Note.} Suppressing the correlation parameters via \texttt{||} works only for numerical covariates in \texttt{lmer} and not for factors. \texttt{afex} provides the functionality to suppress the correlation also among factors if argument \texttt{expand\_re = TRUE} in the call to \texttt{mixed()} (see also function \texttt{lmer\_alt()}).

Examples:  
`mixed(dv ~ within_s_factor * within_i_factor + (within_s_factor|s) + (within_i_factor|i), data, method = "S")`  
`mixed(dv ~ within_s_factor + (within_s_factor||s), data, method = "S", expand_re = TRUE)`

### Hypothesis-Tests for Mixed Models

- `lme4::lmer` does not include *p*-values.
- `afex::mixed` provides four different methods:
    1. Kenward-Roger (`method="KR"`, default): Provides best-protection against anti-conservative results, requires a lot of RAM for complicated random-effects structures.
    2. Satterthwaite (`method="S"`): Similar to KR, but requires less RAM.
    3. Parametric-bootstrap (`method="PB"`): Simulation-based, can take a lot of time (can be speed-up using parallel computation).
    4. Likelihood-ratio tests (`method="LRT"`): Provides worst control for anti-conservative results. Can be used if all else fails or if all random-effects grouping factors have many levels (e.g., over 50).
- `afex::mixed` uses orthogonal contrasts per default. Necessary for categorical variables in interactions.

### Random-Effects Structure

- Omitting random-effects parameters for model terms which vary within the levels of a random-effects grouping factor and for which random variability exists leads to non-iid residuals (i.e., $\epsilon$) and anti-conservative results (e.g., Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013).
- Safeguard is *maximal model justified by the design*.
- If maximal model is overparameterized, contains degenerate estimates, and/or singular fits, power of maximal model may be reduced and a reduced model may be considered (Bates et al., 2015; Matuschek et al., 2017); however, reducing model introduces unknown risk of anti-conservativity, and should be done with caution.
- Steps for running a mixed model analysis:
    1. Identify desired fixed-effects structure
    2. Identify random-effects grouping factors
    3. Identify which factors/terms vary within levels of each random-effects grouping factor: maximal model
    4. Choose method for calculating *p*-values and fit maximal model
    5. Iteratively reduce random-effects structure until all degenerate/zero-variance random-effects parameters are removed.
- If the maximal model shows critical convergence warnings, reduce random-effects structure:
    - Start by removing the correlation among random-effects parameters
    - Remove random-effects parameters for highest-order effects with lowest variance
    - It can sometimes help to try different optimizers
    - Compare *p*-values/fixed-effects estimates across models (*p*-values from degenerate/minimal models are not reliable)

### GLMMs: Mixed-models with Alternative Distributional Assumptions

- Not all data can be reasonable described by a Normal distribution.
- Generalized-linear mixed models (GLMMs; e.g., Jaeger, 2008) allow for other distributions. For example:
    - Binomial distribution: Repeated-measures logistic regression
    - Poisson distribution for count data
    - Gamma distribution for non-negative data (e.g., RTs)
- GLMMs require specification of the conditional distribution of the response (`family`) and link function.
- Link function determines how values on untransformed scale are mapped onto response scale.
- Specification of random-effects structure conceptually identical as for LMMs.
- GLMMs only allow two methods for hypothesis testing: `"LRT"` or `"PB"`.
- Inspection of residuals/model fit more important for GLMMs than for LMMs: R package [`DHARMa`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DHARMa)
- Fit with `lme4::glmer` or `afex::mixed`, both require `family` argument (e.g., `family = binomial`):  
  `mixed(prop ~ a * b + (a|s) + (b|i), data, weights = data$n, family = binomial, method = "LRT")` (Note: `data$n * data$prop` must produce integers; number of successes.)
