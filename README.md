# Statistical Models for Dependent Data: An Introduction to Mixed Models in R

This repo contains the slides and exercise materials for my mixed model workshop. The first instance of this workshop was held as part of the [Data on the Mind 2017](http://www.dataonthemind.org/2017-workshop).

### Requirements
- A recent version of `R` (currently `R 3.4.2`): `https://cran.rstudio.com/`
- `R` packages necessary for the analysis (install with `install.packages("package")` at `R` prompt): `afex` (which automatically installs the additional requirements `lsmeans`, `lme4`, and `car`), `psych` (for example data)
- `R` packages `dplyr`, `broom`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, and `ggplot2` for the exercise (not all might be necessary).
- `R` package `xaringan` to compile the slides.
- A html 5 compatible browser to view the slides.
- `RStudio`: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/#download
